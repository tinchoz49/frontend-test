# Events app!

## Requirements

It's necessary to have the backend process running.

## Install

1. Define an .env file
```
$ mv .env.example .env
```
2. Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
3. Run the app
  1. Running in `development` mode (using webpack and without SSR)
  ```

Your app by default is going to be listening in: `http://localhost:3001`
